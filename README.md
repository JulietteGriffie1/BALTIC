## Abstract
Super-resolution microscopy can resolve cellular features at the nanoscale. However, increased spatial resolution comes with increased phototoxicity, and reduced temporal resolution. As a result, studies that require the highest spatial resolutions often rely on static or fixed images, lacking dynamic information. This is particularly true of bacteria, whose lateral dimensions approach the scale of the diffraction limit. In this work, we present Enso, a method based on unsupervised machine learning to recover bacterial cell cycle and cell type information from static single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) images, whilst retaining nanoscale spatial resolution. Enso uses single-cell images as input, and orders cells according to their spatial pattern progression, ultimately linked to the cell cycle. Our method requires no a priori knowledge or categories, and is validated on both simulated and user-annotated experimental data.
